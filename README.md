# FTP-Server

## Compiling and running

To compile, do `make`.

To run the server, do `./bin/server.out`.

To run the client, do `./bin/client.out`.

Please avoid changing directory to `bin` using `cd`. The programs assume the current working directory is the root directory, and that the `server` folder with the associated `users.txt` are there.
