# FTP-Server

## Compiling and running

To compile, do `make`.

To run the server, do `cd bin` and then `./server.out`. When running the server, please ensure the current working directory is `bin` (the directory with the binaries); the server assumes this is the case so that it reads the necessary files in `bin/server`.

To run the client, you can do `cd bin` and then `./client.out`. However, the client may be run from anywhere on the system.
